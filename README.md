# OpenBeam Tantillus
+ This is a work in progress.
+ Inspired by Intrinsically-Sublime's [Tantillus]

## Features
+ Parametric. Edit Parameters.scad to change pretty much anything about the design (even build area).
+ Enclosed. The frame will enclose everything, besides, maybe the power supply
+ Every feature of the original [Tantillus] (except maybe size).
+ T - Slot Extrusion Frame - Sturdy
+ [Airtripper Extruder] mount holes.
+ [FastBot BBP] mounting.
+ Uses either Igubal bearings or bronze bushings.

## How do I build one?
It would be pretty hard to build one right now, as we haven't published a BOM
or a build guide. We plan on uploading the STL and SVG files for a 6 x 6 x 6 build
volume version using [openbeam]. These files will probably be hosted on thingiverse. All parts will be metric, with the screws being
M3, and the threaded rods will be M4.
We will also upload a BOM for this version, with links to McMaster Carr parts.
There may be a build guide uploaded to the github wiki.
